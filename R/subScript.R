#' subScript will submit a script to the cluster
#'
#' calls subJob to submit a script to the cluster as a temporary file it relies on the temporary
#' directory where the temporary file will be written to being mounted to the local machine.
#' I could get round this by writing it locally and then copying it with scp but at the moment
#' this is not worth the effort.
#'
#' @param scriptstub the stub for the temporary file name
#' @param script the content of the script as a vector of strings
#' @param tmpdir location for the temporary file
#' @param scriptext extention for the temporary file
#' @param logdir location for the batch job logs
#'
#' @export
